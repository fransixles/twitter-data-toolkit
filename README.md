# Twitter Data Toolkit

'twitter-data-app' is a Node.js project that allows users to identify their bearer token (application-only authentication), collect Tweets using Twitter's premium search endpoints and aggregate Tweets into one file (JSON or CSV) for analysis purposes without having to interact with code. Everything's done through a simple web application. Feel free to email me (<s.kishore@auckland.ac.nz>) if you need support with collecting data.
